        <p><b>The unrestricted dumping of plastic and medical waste, and even animal carcasses into the Kodappamund
                channel
                continues to cause low lying parts of Udhagamandalam town to become inundated with overflowing rain and
                sewage water during spells of moderate rain</b>. <br><br><i>On Monday evening, a brief shower that
                lasted for around two
                hours and brought with it around 50 millimeters of rain to Udhagamandalam town led to the bus depot
                attached
                to the Udhagamandalam bus stand becoming flooded.</i></p>

        <p>On Tuesday, a visit to the mouth of the Kodappamund Channel, which starts off as a pristine stream from
            Doddabetta less than five kilometers upstream, and gradually becomes polluted by sewage and waste that gets
            dumped into the channel, showed that the outlet pipe that drains into the Ooty Lake, choked with tonnes of
            plastic.

            Workers employed by the Water Resources Department said that they had been working since 6 a.m. on Tuesday
            morning, to remove waste and debris that had collected at the mouth of the outlet pipe at the sewage
            treatment plant in Udhagamandalam.

            They complained that apart from the tonnes of plastic waste that blocks the pipe, they also find used
            syringes and medical waste that is dumped into the channel making its way to the facility. “People even dump
            animal carcasses, including pet animals that have died, into the channel,” said one of the workers.</p>

        <h3>Centre asks UPSC to cancel latest advertisement for lateral entry in bureaucracy</h3>

        <p>Two days after the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) issued advertisements for lateral recruitment into
            government service for 45 posts of Joint Secretary, Director and Deputy Secretary levels, the government
            moved to cancel these planned recruitments, citing social justice.

            Minister for the Department of Personnel and Training, Dr. Jitendra Singh wrote to the UPSC Chairperson
            Priti Sudan on Tuesday (August 20, 2024) asking that the advertisements be withdrawn, and plans for
            recruitment cancelled. Mr. Singh’s move came after protests by the Opposition against the Centre’s decision.
            Even NDA ally Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) declared that entry into government service without quotas set aside
            for Scheduled Castes and Tribes was “unacceptable”.
